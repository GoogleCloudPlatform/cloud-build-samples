# code-examples
This repository contains code examples used in the official Cloud Build [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/).

## Contributing changes

### New samples
 - New samples are accepted at reviewer discretion.
 - New samples should come with a `README` either linking to documentation or explaining how to use the sample directly. If the `README` is excessively long, the instructions should be moved to a tutorial and linked from the `README`.
 - The configuration file (e.g. `cloudbuild.yaml`) should be able to run as part of automated testing.  This means that in general, the file should contain substitutions rather than dummy values that the user has to manually replace.  _Some exceptions to this rule may be allowed with sufficient justification_. 
 - Sample should be readable. Use clear comments, descriptive variable names, and try to avoid excessively long lines. 

### Bug Fixes
 - Bug fixes are welcome, either as pull requests or as GitHub issues.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to contribute.
